        <h2>Getting Started in VRDC</h2>
        <p>Use the CCW guides online to set up the VRDC. CCW has instructions about file transfers for uploading/downloading which are important to refer back to.</p>

        <h3>SAS Enterprise Guide (EG):</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Log into SAS Enterprise using your username in <strong>lowercase</strong>.</li>
            <li>In <em>Servers/sasCCW/Libraries</em>, all the data files are displayed.</li>
            <li>We can only access the data files that we requested (almost all files) but can see all of them.</li>
            <li>You can’t move things into different folders because it will copy everything to memory.</li>
            <li>If you ever get logged out or can’t log in in SAS EG, just click “<em>No Profile Selected</em>” in the bottom right corner and click <em>Cloud SAS</em>. The login screen will pop up again, and you can log in.</li>
            <li>Saving files in SAS: Save to the folder <code>SH058994</code> which can be found under libraries.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>R/Python/Stata Usage:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All three are opened through the <strong>Jupyter icon</strong>.</li>
            <li>For R and Python, you can just open a kernel or notebook. For Stata, you need to be on the equivalent of the home screen to open a Stata instance.</li>
            <li>You can’t read giant datasets into R/Python (24GB memory limit). Consider splitting them up by month and reading separately. Also, remove any columns you don’t need before exporting from SAS.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Other Coding Considerations:</h3>
        <p>You can’t copy code out of the VRDC. So, keep it in a shared folder in the VRDC that everyone can access. If you want to send it outside, or especially to keep a backup, you need to type it outside of the VRDC and then copy it inside.</p>
        <p>The easiest and most efficient method is to type everything locally (in any word processor), and then copying all of the script as text. In Stata, the VRDC can’t be copied into directly, but you can open Notepad++ (inside the VRDC) and copy into that, then copy into Stata as a two-step process.</p>

        <h3>File Locations:</h3>
        <p>Our scripts/data are saved under server <code>sasCCW/Files/dua_058994</code>, which is a shared drive we can all access that has lots of subfolders. This can’t be accessed through Windows file editor, but you can save from SAS or any of the other programming languages, which have that as their home directory.</p>
        <p>Everyone also has their own unique filepath to access data on the shared drive. This means that the line below points to a specific file on one account, but you would need to replace <code>xxxxxx</code> with your 6-digit username.</p>
        <pre><code>/sas/vrdc/users/xxxxxx/files/dua_058994/data/oud_definition/data/output/MA_final_OUD_&nextyr..csv</code></pre>
