                <strong>Transition to T-MSIS Analytic Files (TAF):</strong>
                <p>
                    Starting in 2014, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) began to transition from MSIS to the <strong>Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T-MSIS)</strong>. As a result, MAX data have been phased out as states converted their data submissions to the T-MSIS format. CMS now produces <strong>T-MSIS Analytic Files (TAF)</strong>, which serve a similar purpose but are based on the newer T-MSIS data format, providing enhanced data quality and additional variables.

        <h2 id="national-death-index">National Death Index (1999 - present)</h2>
        <p>Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services provides the National Death Index (NDI) files only through the Virtual Research Data Center
            maintained by the Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse (CCW). As of October 2024, <a href = "https://resdac.org/cms-data/files/mbsf-ndi"> Medicare NDI files </a>
            are available for 1999-2021 and <a href = "https://resdac.org/cms-data/files/mesf-ndi"> Medicaid NDI files </a> are available for 1999-2020.
            Medicaid NDI files, however, are not available for all states and years. In contrast to the enrollment files (Medicare Master Beneficiary
            Summary file, the Medicaid Analytic Extract Personal Summary file, and the Medicaid T-MSIS Analytic Demographic and Eligibility file) that
            contain only the death date, NDI files provide detailed information of the decedents such as date, state, and cause of death. The information
            is obtained through a linkage with official death certificate from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). To facilitate the link,
            CCW first constructs a finder file that contains Medicare decedents for a given year and Medicaid decedents in any year recorded in the enrollment
            files. Then the finder file is sent to NCHS to obtain the detailed information about the decedents. Hence, while a Medicare NDI file for a given
            year contains only Medicare beneficiaries that were enrolled in Medicare in the year of the NDI file, a Medicaid NDI file for a given year contains
            all Medicaid beneficiaries ever enrolled in Medicaid up to the year and in the year of the NDI file.</p>
